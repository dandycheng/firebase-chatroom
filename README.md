# firebase-chatroom

A mini project made as a proof of concept; it is comprised of:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JS (Pure JS and Node.js)

Initialization:
  * Run ```npm install``` in the _server_ directory to install dependencies
  * CORS is required for some of the pages (Such as login) in order to have full functionality (Keep track of browser console for CORS
    error messages)
  * **Sign up** is required before using the chatroom


**Note that it is made to understand the concepts, and is not a fully fledged project.**
